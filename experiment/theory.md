# Theory:-
Phenol formaldehyde resins (PFs) are condensation polymers and are obtained by
condensing phenol with formaldehyde in the presence of an acidic or alkaline catalyst. They were
first prepared by Backeland, an American Chemist who gave them the name as Bakelite. These are
thermosetting polymers.<br>
<b>Thermosets:-</b><br>The polymers which on heating change irreversibly into hard rigid and infusible
materials are called thermosetting polymers. These polymers are usually prepared by heating
relatively low molecular mass, semi fluid polymers, which becomes infusible and form an insoluble
hard mass on heating. The hardening on heating is due to the formation of extensive cross-linking
between different polymeric chains. This lead to the formation of a 3-Dimnesional network of bonds
connecting the polymer chains. Since the 3D network structure is rigid and does not soften on
heating, the thermosetting polymers can not be reprocessed. Some important examples of
thermosetting polymers are Urea-Formaldehyde resin and Melamine-Formaldehyde resins.<br>

<b>Properties:-</b>
 1. Phenol- formaldehyde resins having low degree of polymerization are soft.<br>
 2. They possess excellent adhesive properties and are usually used as bonding glue for laminated wooden planks and in varnishes and lackuers.<br>
 3. Phenol- formaldehyde resins having high degree of polymerization are hard, rigid, scratchresistant and infusible.<br>
 4. They are resistant to non-oxidising acids, salts and many organic solvents.<br>
 5. They can withstand very high temperatures.<br>
 6. They act as excellent electrical insulators also.

<b>Uses:-</b>
1. They are used for making moulded articles such as radio and TV parts, combs, fountain pen, barrels, phonograph records etc.<br>
2. They are used for making decorative laminates, wall coverings etc.<br>
3. They are used for making electrical goods such as switches, plugs etc.<br>
4. They are used for impregnating fabrics wood and paper.<br>
5. They are used as bonding glue for for laminated wooden planks and in varnishes and lackuers.<br>
6. Sulphonated phenol-formaldehyde resins are use as ion-exchange resins.
