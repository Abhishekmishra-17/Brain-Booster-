#### 1. Focus Area : Exprimentation and Data Analysis

The students know the concept of thermosetting plastic ,condensation polymerization,molecular reaction. They do the experimentation based on the formula, trial and error and learn from it. They do the experiment in the presence an acid catalyst when phenol reacts with excess formaldehyde, a linear P-F(Phenol- formaldehyde) resin novolac is formed.
