#### 1. Focus Area : Exprimentation and Data Analysis

The students know the concept of thermosetting plastic ,condensation polymerization,molecular reaction. They do the experimentation based on the formula, trial and error and learn from it. They do the experiment in the presence an acid catalyst when phenol reacts with excess formaldehyde, a linear P-F(Phenol- formaldehyde) resin novolac is formed.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Describe the method for condensation polymerization <br> Condensation polymers are any kind of polymers formed through a condensation reaction—where molecules join together—losing small molecules as byproducts such as water or methanol. | Students click on "Procedure" button <br> to see the concepts, steps and all information. | What is condensation polymerization?
2.| Examine the nature of Phenol-formaldehyde(P-F) resin on heating <br>  |  Students click on "add" button for adding required apparatus <br> and by clicking on "select" button they will able to select particular reagent.  | 1 Phenol formaldehyde is in form of:- <br> <b>A. Solid<br></b> B. Liquid <br> C. Gas <br> D. Plasma 

3.| Examine the nature of Phenol-formaldehyde(P-F) resin on heating <br>  |  Students click on "add" button for adding required apparatus <br> and by clicking on "select" button they will able to select particular reagent.  | 1 Phenol formaldehyde is in form of:- <br> <b>A. Solid<br></b> B. Liquid <br> C. Gas <br> D. Plasma
