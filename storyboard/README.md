## Storyboard (Round 2)

Delete this line before submission : The core principle of Round 2 is to make the lab/experiment documentation elaborated in a manner that it makes easy for any person (developer/domain and non domain faculty/student) to understand and develop the lab/experiment.

Experiment 1: Preparation of Phenol-formaldehyde resin.
### 1. Story Outline:

Phenol-formaldehyde resin is also known as **phenolic resin** which is a type of thermosetting plastic. It is synthesized by condensation polymerization and cross-linking of phenol and formaldehyde by heating in presence of acid catalyst **Novolac** and bakelite are well known P-F resin.<br>In presence of a base catalyst another P-F resin **Resol** is obtained. Atcommercial scale they are used in lamination, thermal resistance, adhessive and many more.<br> The chemical composition of phenoland formaldehyde and their combination into network are interlinked permanently that give them rigid and hard structure,it is due to crosslinked networking.

### 2. Story:

Describe the Story intorduction here (guide : The next step is to write a story. Story should be a brief logical description in simple English. It should talk about the overall execution of the experiment in a simplified manner. (should not include any equations/ drawings). The story should include the following points) )

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
The students has to click "Start" on simulator page for starting the experiment and they has to go through instructions provided by simulator on "Procedure" section. The user must know the stepwise procedure also. <br>
1.Click **Start**:Apparatus will be shown. <br>
2.A next procedure will popup on the page, by which user will understand better. <br>
3.Click **Next**: Chemical and apparatus will appear and also selected amount as mentioned in procedure. <br>
4. Then click **Next**:Next procedure will be shown and student will follow that procedure. <br>
5.When all procedure is done by student correctly then the result will show without any caution. <br>
6. When student wants to start from begining once again then he/she will click on **Reset** button on the screen.  

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Describe the objectives and goals in details here : (guide : The user should clearly understand the aims and objective of the experiment. ( how he will begin experiment. ?  in descriptive))

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

Describe the pathway activites here : (Guide : Set the pathway activities in line with the learning objectives (LOs)  & with a view to achieve the goals set in round #0 & round#1.  (once he begins, how he will traverse through the entire experiment ? in descriptive))

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:
1. Learning objective:**Remember** <br>

Question 1. In presence of P-F resin, the catalyst is:<br> A. Phenol<br> B. Formaldehyde<br> **C. Hydrochloric Acid**<br> D. Water<br>

Question 2. The P-F resin is a:<br> A. Rubber<br> **B. Thermosetting Plastic**<br> C. Thermoplastic<br> D. Addition Polymer

2. Learning objective:**Evaluate** <br>

Question 1. A condensation reaction:<br> A. Two group are added only<br> **B. Two group form another group**<br> C. It is a decomposition reaction<br> D. It is a subsitution reaction <br>

Question 2. Phenol is an:<br> **A. Organic compound**<br> B. Inorganic compound<br> C. Atom<br> D. Non-carbon compound

3. Learning objective:**Analyse** <br>

Question1: Solid P-F rein float on water due to:<br> A. It is soluble in water<br> **B. It is insoluble in water**<br> C. It can react with water<br> D. All above <br>

Question 1. P-F resin is:<br> A. A simple molecule <br> B. A complex compound<br> **C. A polymer**<br> D. None

4. Learning objective:**Examine** <br>

Question 1. P-F resin can be prepared by:<br> A. reaction of acetic acid and phenol <br> B. phenol and HCl <br> C. HCl and formaldehyde<br> **D. phenol and formaldehyde** <br>

Question 2. P-F resin is used as:<br> **A. Adhessive**<br> B. Food<br> C. Clothing<br> D. Motor 



##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
1. If user missed to add a major chemical:<br> <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bullet" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bullet" title="\bullet" /></a> Caution indication of **"Please use proper chemical"** <br>
2. If user does not select correct amount:<br><a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\bullet" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\bullet" title="\bullet" /></a> Caution indication of **"Please choose correct amount of chemical"** <br>

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Describe conclusion here : (guide: This may include displaying: how much time did the user take to solve the questions/ How many questions were right?/ How many hints did the learner use. Based on this the evaluation/marking to be suggested to the user. (once he is towards the completion of the experiment, what LO he is taking along with him, what will be his probable, interpretation/conclusion , descriptive) )

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
Type equations here : (guide : ( a separate sheet having equations / programs for the lab exper3ment to be shared along with the Story submissions (1) . You can mark it as numerical reference numbers within the story narration (like we cite in the research papers) and then separately share these equations/programs sheets as a reference, do not include the equations as a whole in the narration))
